# Twitch Clip Grabber
Python script to grab and download top clips for a given streamer.
Currently a proof of concept - more features to be added soon!

## Use
Currently, this script will grab one of the top clips from the past week for a streamer. 
  `py main.py -u [streamer username]`
  
## Dependencies
